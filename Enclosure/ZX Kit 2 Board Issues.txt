PROBLEM: MREQ net labeled "MREQL" on CPU/ULA but "MREQ" on OR gate.
RESULT: Missing connection between CPU and OR gate on board casuing upper RAM conflict
SOLUTION: Bridge MREQ from CPU to OR gate.

PROBLEM: IORQ on CPU not connected to anything.
RESULT: Can't read keyboard from ULA (and would cause other issues too)
SOLUTION: Added a 470 ohm resister and wire between CPU's IOREQ and ULA's IOREQ (rest of circuit was placed correctly just missed this connection)

PROBLEM: INTL on ULA not connected to anything.
RESULT: System doesn't work
SOLUTION: Added a 470 ohm resister and wire between CPU's INT and ULA's INT

PROBLEM: Jumbled text on screen as a result of address bus conflict
SOLUTION: Between the MUX and ULA, use 680 ohm resisters instead of 330 (470 may work as well)

PROBLEM: ROM CE not connected to anything
RESULT: ROM doesn't work right.
SOLUTION:
OR the CPU's MREQ and the ULA's ROM_CS (through 600 ohm resistor) together, send result to ROM CE
Connect ROM_OE to CPU's READ instead of ROM_CS (move the resistor) 




NEED TO CHECK TAPE LOADING NEXT!




NEED TO ADD / CHANGE:

DONE - Remove 2k pullup on CASS/SPEAKER line to enable modern "tape" loading

DONE - Move (2) 10k resisters out from under ULA!

DONE - 15pf cap on ground side of 14MHz crystal

DONE - 1/2 watt 15 ohm thick film resistor for ULA VCC SMD case style 1210

DONE - 10uf ELEC cap on reset button for system start

DONE - ELEC CAP on lower 5v rail for speaker compensation
